### Crypto Factor Bridge

The Crypto Factor Bridge allows users to obtain DFI in a decentralised way.
With QuickSwap, a user with tokens on Polygon can sell them to buy cDFI.
Then, using the Crypto Factor bridge at [https://cassets.crypto-factor.io/bridge](https://cassets.crypto-factor.io/bridge), users can bridge cDFI (Crypto Factor DFI) on Polygon to DeFiMetaChain, and then swap it to DFI as necessary. 

### Exchanges

- Bitrue ([DFI-USDT](https://www.bitrue.com/trade/dfi_usdt))

On Bitrue, you can place market, limit, or trigger orders to purchase or sell DFI with USDT.

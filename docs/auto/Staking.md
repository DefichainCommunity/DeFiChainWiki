description: Staking - DeFiChain's Proof of Stake mechanism to secure the network. Preventing malicious users to take over the network.
---

DeFiChain uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) model to secure the network. Users must stake a certain amount of DFI to create a masternode. Masternodes are nodes that are allowed to create blocks and receive block rewards for doing so.
If a masternode acts maliciously, it is locked. This prevents malicious actors from gaining control of the network unless they have a large amount of DFI to stake. It is important to note that banned masternodes do not occur randomly, but are only caused by malicious users.

Currently, the required amount of DFI is 20,000 DFI, but it is possible to use a service provider such as Bake (https://bake.io/) or Crypto Factor (https://linktr.ee/crypto.factor) to stake less than this amount.
